## Bioinformatics_resources
This repository containÂ *resources* that I found useful on my path to **mastering Bioinformatics**. There are links to proper sites with proper documentation of concepts, books, and other sources of information.

#### An array of Bioinformatics techniques to grasp
- [Rmd guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) - Concepts of Git and Github
- [GWENA:](https://github.com/Kumquatum/GWENA)- An Awesome pipeline to construct a Biological network, Module construction and Enrichment analysis
- [WCL](http://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/01-introduction/index.html) - A guide for efficient pipeline writing and sharing
- [How to use Sratoolkit](https://www.reneshbedre.com/blog/ncbi_sra_toolkit.html) - A guidance to effectively using SRAtool
- [Using du and df](https://www.pair.com/support/kb/paircloud-du-and-df/) - These are important commands to know disk utilization and storage space use. The commands are particularly important when using HPC resources
#### WGCNA papers
-[DGE + Network analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6788446/) - This paper combines network analysis and differential gene expression. It includes actual codes used in analysis pipeline.
-[WGCNA and DGE analysis](https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2019/09130/using_weighted_gene_co_expression_network_analysis.30.aspx)- This paper has the pipeline to conduct DGE and network analysis
