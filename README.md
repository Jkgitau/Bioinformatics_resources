## Bioinformatics_resources
This repository containÂ *resources* that I found useful on my path to **mastering Bioinformatics**. There are links to proper sites with proper documentation of concepts, books, and other sources of information.

#### An array of Bioinformatics techniques to grasp
- [Rmd guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) - Concepts of Git and Github
- [GWENA:](https://github.com/Kumquatum/GWENA)- An Awesome pipeline to construct a Biological network, Module construction and Enrichment analysis
- [WCL](http://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/01-introduction/index.html) - A guide for efficient pipeline writing and sharing
- [How to use Sratoolkit](https://www.reneshbedre.com/blog/ncbi_sra_toolkit.html) - A guidance to effectively using SRAtool
- [Using du and df](https://www.pair.com/support/kb/paircloud-du-and-df/) - These are important commands to know disk utilization and storage space use. The commands are particularly important when using HPC resources
- [Using R](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/aio/index.html) - A good R learning platform
- [Differential gene expression](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/planning_successful_rnaseq/lessons/sample_level_QC.html#:~:text=First%2C%20the%20count%20data%20needs,using%20your%20tool%20of%20interest.) - Analysis steps to counduct differential gene expression of RNA-Seq data
- [Havard bioinformatics core](https://github.com/hbctraining) - Bioinformatics training by harvard bioinformatics core
- [Sample work of WGCNA](https://www.polarmicrobes.org/weighted-gene-correlation-network-analysis-wgcna-applied-to-microbial-communities/) - An example of analysis pipeline with code and results obtained.
#### WGCNA papers
- [DGE + Network analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6788446/) - This paper combines network analysis and differential gene expression. It includes actual codes used in analysis pipeline.
- [WGCNA and DGE analysis](https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2019/09130/using_weighted_gene_co_expression_network_analysis.30.aspx)- This paper has the pipeline to conduct DGE and network analysis.

#### Breast cancer papers
- [Network analysis paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6688090/) - This is aa well curated paper that describes Gene co-expression analysis

#### Contaminating DNA Project
- [viGEN pipeline](https://github.com/Jkgitau/viGEN) - An elaborate methodology used to conduct this study. All the code, tools and exaplanations are provided

#### You tube channels
